name: Deep-learning-aided dismantling of interdependent networks
description: Identifying the minimal set of nodes whose removal breaks a complex network
  apart, also referred as the network dismantling problem, is a highly non-trivial
  task with applications in multiple domains, Whereas network dismantling has been
  extensively studied over the past decade, research has primarily focused on the
  formulations of the optimization problem for single-layer networks, neglecting that
  many, if not all, real networks display multiple layers of interdependent interactions.
  in such networks, the optimization problem is fundamentally different as the effect
  of removing nodes propagates within and across layers in a way that can not be predicted
  using a single-layer perspective. Here, we propose a dismantling algorithm namedMultiDismantler,
  which leverages multiplex network representation and deep reinforcement learning
  to optimally dismantle multi-layer interdependent networks. MultiDismantler is trained
  on small synthetic multiplex graphs; when applied to large real and synthetic networks,
  it displays exceptional dismantling performance, clearly outperforming all existing
  methods that rely on a single-laver approach to network dismantling. We show that
  MultiDismantler is effective in guiding strategies for the containment of diseases
  in social networks characterized by multiple layers of social interactions. Also,
  we show that the multi-dismantler is useful in the design of protocols aimed at
  delaying the onset of cascading failures in interdependent critical infrastructures.
